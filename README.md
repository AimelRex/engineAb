A java game engine with LWJGL

Right now i'm following FreeCodeCamp's class The code has a lot of explanation to it When i'll finish the course i'll customize it more, I'll try to make a raycaster or something fun like that (maybe real 3d ?)

I'm also using : Gradle (you can get the build.gradle somewhere in the files) intellij
